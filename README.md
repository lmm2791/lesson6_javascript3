### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. We learned about scripting the DOM and the types of most commonly used DOM nodes. They are document, element, attribute and text.
2. I learned to pay attention to what the app is supposed to do. I thought my code was broken when I opened it and only saw three pictures. After some frantic proofreading, I realized that 5 pictures only appear AFTER you click the button. D'oh!
3. We also learned a bit about default actions and how to cancel them. Related to that was how to preload images, which I believe we also used in the assignment.
